# mactrack

The MacTrack plugin is designed to scan network switches, routers and intellegent hubs for connected devices, and record their location either based upon the portname or alias of the switch or hub.  It also attempts to discover the ip address of the mac address from the routers included in the MacTrack database.  MacTrack can also use arpwatch to gether IP to MAC address associations.

MacTrack has the ability to also notify admins or security personnel when the MAC address of a missing or stolen computer re-appears on the network.  This can be helpful in recovering lost equipment.  Through MacTrack's interface monitoring feature, a Network Administrator can get a very good idea of where utilization is, where there are errors, etc within their network.

## Features

* Scans Devices
* Finds Macs
* Associates Macs with their IP's
